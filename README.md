### MyKeyTakeAways

**1. What is Deep Learning?**
*Machine Learning is turning things(data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers. Deep learning is a subset of Machine Learning.*

**2. Why use Machine Learning(or deep learning)?**
 **Better reasone**: *For a complex problem, can you think of all the rules?*
 *"If you can build a **simple rule-based)**(maybe not very simple.)system that doesn't require machine learning, do that"*
 
 [Rules of ML by Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml)
 
 **3. What deep learning is good for**

- **Problems with long lists of rules** --*when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/deep learning may help.*
- **Continually changing environments** â€” *deeplearning can adapt('learn') to new scenaries*.
- **Discovering insights within large collections of data**â€”*can you imagine trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different kinds of food look like?*

**4. What deep learning is (typically) not good for**
- **When you need explainability**â€”*the patterns learned by a deep learning model are typically uninterpretable by a human.*
- **When the traditional approach is a better option**â€” *if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system.*
- **When errors are unacceptable**â€” *since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predictable.*
- **When you don't have much data**â€”- *deep learnings models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great results.*

**5. Machine Learning Vs Deep Learning**

**6. Alogrithms**

|**Machine Learning**|**Neural Network**|
|--------------------|------------------|
| Random Forest | Neural Networks|
| Naive Bayes | Fully Connected Neural Network|
|Nearest Neighbour| Convolutional Neural Network|
|Support Vector Machine| Recurrent Neural Network|
|....Many More| Transformer and ..many more|

**7. What are Neural Networks?**
![Neural Network](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66157611/127770385-a1d295f0-7e88-4792-b876-89aaed63bb5b.png)

**8. What is Deep Learning already being used for?**
* *Recommedation Engine*
* *Translation*
* *Speech Recognition*
* *Computer Vision*
* *Natural Language Processing(NLP)*

**9. What is and why use TensorFlow?**
- End-to-end platform for machine learning.
- Write fast deep learning code in Python/other accessible languages (able to run on a GPU/TPU)
- Able to access many pre-built deep learning models (TensorFlow Hub).
- Whole stack: preprocess data, model data, deploy model in your application
- Originally designed and used in-house by Google (now open-source).*


**10. What is Tensor?**
*It is a numerical representation of data in an aray*



> **Note: A scalar has no dimension, A vector has one dimension (ex: [[10,10]]), A matrix has two dimensions. A tensor has three or more dimensions**

**11. Creating tensors with TensorFlow and tf.Variable()**

*We can assign a num to tf.Variable()(changeable tensors)[e.g. by changeable_tensors.assign[0].assign(7)] and we can't assign  a num to tf.Constant()(unchangeable tensors)*

> ðŸ”‘**Note:** Rarely in practice will you need to decide whether to use tf.constant or tf.Variable to create tensors, as TensorFlow does this for you. However, if in doubt, use tf.constant and change it later if needed.

**12. Shuffle Dataset**

*Why we have to shuffle dataset?*

*The main reason we have to shuffle the train data, for example if have images dataset with length 15000. The first 10000 images have one same category and last 5000 has different category. Then if we train with only 10000 dataset to avoid overfitting. Then our model only learn one category. To train other category we have to shuffle the dataset*

 > **Rule 4:** "If both the global and the operation seed are set: Both seeds are used in conjunction to determine the random sequence".

**13. Tensor Attributes**

|**Attribute**|**Meaning**|**Code**|
|-------------|-----------|--------|
|Shape| The length (number of elements) of each of the dimensions of a tensor| `tensor.shape`|
|Rank| The number of tensor dimensions, A scalar has rank 0, a vector has rank 1, a matrix is rank 2, a tensor has rank n| `tensor.ndim`|
|Axis or dimension| A particular dimension of a tensor| `tensor[0], tensor[:,1]`..|
|Size| The total number of items in the tensor|`tf.size(tensor)`|

**14. Matrix Multiplication with Tensors**

*In machine learning, matrix multiplication is one of the most common tensor operations.*
[http://matrixmultiplication.xyz/](http://matrixmultiplication.xyz/)

[matrix-multiplying.html](https://mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-multiplying.html)

> There are two rules our tensors (or matrices) need to fulfill if we're going to matrix multiply them.
  - The inner dimensions must match.
  - The resulting matrix has the shape of the outer dimensions.

 ![2021-06-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66157611/127771382-5342f1d4-a4aa-4a05-bfb5-9e5d9f6d43ee.png)


> **Generally, when performing matrix multiplication on two tensors and one of the axes doesn't line up, you will transpose (rather than reshape ) one of the tensors to get satisfy the matrix multiplication rules.**

**15. Changing the datatype of a tensor**

 [mixed_precision](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision)

 **16. Aggregating tensors**

  *Aggregating tensors = condensing them from multiple values down to a smaller amount of values.*

  *For **tf.math.reduce_std** and **tf.math.reduce_variance** input tensor must be in real or complex type. So, just convert your data to float before passing to these functions*

 *Try different functions from these below link.*

[tf.math](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/reduce_variance)

 **17. Squeezing a tensor.**
 
 What squeezing does is removes dimensions of size 1 from the shape of a tensor.

**18.One-Hot Encoding Tensors.**

 [https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/)

**19. Tensors and NumPy**

> ðŸ”‘**Note:** One of the main differences between a TensorFlow tensor and a NumPy array is that a Tensor can be run on GPU or TPU (for faster numerical processing).

**What is transfer learning?**

Surely someone has spent the time crafting the right model for the job

Leverage our work, we will adapt the model which has already built on it like IMAGENET and use it on our model.

**Why use transfer learning?**

- Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.
- Can leverage a working network architecture which has already learned patterns on similar data to our own (often results in great results with less data)

**What are callbacks?**

- Callbacks are a tool which can add helpful functionality to your models during training, evaluation or inference.
- Some popular callbacks include:
